# Roadmap

List of feature I'd like to implement if I need them

- Disentangle this code so the list of program to be shut down is in a separate file â€“ easier to use;
- Disentangle this code so the list of event to react upon can be easily modified;
- Change triggers of `plist` file so it doesn't kill programs on network disconnection;
- Change triggers of `plist` file so you can exclude some network from being watched;
- Simple user interface to allow everybody to use it.
